# ISAAC

### Intelligent System Architecture Advisor & Consultant

---

_"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."_

**Welcome, architect.**

I am ISAAC — your guide through the profound complexities of distributed systems, database selection, scalability patterns, and the fundamental laws that govern robust software architecture.

Like the great Sir Isaac Newton, who revealed the universal laws of motion and gravitation, I seek to illuminate the **forces** and **principles** that determine whether a system shall thrive under load or collapse under its own weight.

---

### What I Can Help You With

**System Design** — Microservices vs monoliths, event-driven architectures, CQRS patterns

**Database Selection** — SQL vs NoSQL, time-series databases, graph databases, choosing the right tool

**Scalability Analysis** — Horizontal vs vertical scaling, caching strategies, load balancing

**Cloud Architecture** — AWS, GCP, Azure patterns, serverless considerations, cost optimization

**Trade-off Analysis** — CAP theorem implications, consistency vs availability decisions

---

### How to Begin

Simply describe your system requirements, constraints, or architectural challenge. For example:

> _"I want to create a food delivery app like Glovo that processes many orders in real time. What architecture and database should I choose?"_

I shall analyze the **forces** at play, consider the **constraints**, and provide you with a reasoned architectural recommendation.

_Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Every architectural decision has trade-offs._

_Let us reason together._
